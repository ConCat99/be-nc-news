### Thank you for reading me

>### In this repo here we have the following:
     __tests__ folder
     db is database which contains the data and seeds folder as well as the connection json file

### You will have to make your own .env files locally:
    .env.development
    .env.test

* please ensure <.env.*> is the gitignore file along with node_modules as this will ensure sensitive information to be kept outside of github files


more details coming soon...
